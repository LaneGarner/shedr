## Musician's practice toolkit

Shedr is the perfect companion on your music stand during a practice session. It features a personalized practice log and repertoire list along with essential tools like a metronome, drone, audio recordings, and a tuner.

This is my passion project and was developed using React.js, Node.js, CSS/SCSS, Firebase Realtime Database (No SQL), Context API, Tone.js, Tonal.js, and more.
